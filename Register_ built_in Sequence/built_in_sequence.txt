uvm_reg_hw_reset_seq = check that the hardware register reset value matches the value specified in the register model.
uvm_reg_single_bit_bash_seq =writes, then check_reads 1's and 0's to all bits of the selected register that have read-write access.
uvm_reg_bit_bash_seq= Execute the uvm_reg_single_bit_bash_seq for each register in the selected block and any sub-block it may contains.
uvm_reg_single_access_seq = write to the selected register via the frontdoor,checks the value is correctly written via backdoor, then writes  value via the backdoor and checks that it
                            can be read back correctly via the frontdoor.Repeated for each address map that the register is present in.Requires that the backdoor hdl_path has been specified.
uvm_reg_access_seq= Execute the uvm_reg_single_access_seq for each register accessible via the selected block.
uvm_reg_shared_access_seq= for each map containing the register,writes to the selected register in one map, then check-reads it back from all maps from ehich it is accessible .
                            Requires that the selected register has been added to multiple address maps.
